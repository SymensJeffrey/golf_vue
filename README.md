My family and I LOVE golf and get very competitive. We have tournaments every year and there are not a lot of options out there to keep track of everyones scores as the round goes on. That is why I created Scoreboard, a web app that allows you to create a tournament and link scorecards to track how everyone is playing and to stay updated on the scores. So check it out and make sure to him em straight!
